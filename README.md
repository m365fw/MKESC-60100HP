# MKESC-60100HP
## 1. Product introduction
MKSESC 60100HP is an upgraded version based on VESC6. MKSESC 60100HP has a three-phase shunt and an adjustable current/voltage filter. For current sampling, AD8418A is used as a phase line sampling chip. Compared with the low-cost INA181A1 low-end sampling method , phase line sampling allows for more accurate and reliable detection of any connected motor. MKESC 60100HP is fully compatible with VESC6. With the help of VESC TOOL (including PC devices and Android mobile devices) provided by VESC for free, almost all professional-level projects can be set up within minutes after simple operations.

## 2. Product Features
